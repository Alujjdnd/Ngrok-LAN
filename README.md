## Temp Docs
- Will hitch a bit for now, especially on first load.

## TODO
- Add ModMenu integration to ~~input Auth Token~~, Enabled checkbox, and Ngrok region select dropdown
- See if can make process parallel, so that the "Open to LAN" button doesn't 
hitch
- Print exception log to chat to diagnose issues
- Add common issues with Ngrok
